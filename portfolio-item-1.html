        <p>It is also known as expense manager and money manager, an expense tracker is a software or application that helps to keep an accurate record of your money inflow and outflow. Many people in India live on a fixed income, and they find that towards the end of the month they don't have sufficient money to meet their needs.</p>
        <p>This Expense Tracker is a web application that facilitates the users to keep track and manage their personal as well as business expenses. This application helps the users to keep a digital diary. It will keep track of a user's income and expenses on a daily basis. The user will be able to add his/her expenditures instantly and can review them anywhere and anytime with the help of the internet. He/she can easily import transactions from his/her mobile wallets without risking his/her information and efficiently protecting his/her privacy. It is common to delete files accidentally or misplace files. This expense tracker provides a complete digital solution to this problem. Excel sheets do very little to help in tracking .Furthermore, they don't have the advanced functionality of preparing graphical visuals automatically. Not only will it save the time of the people but also it will assure error free calculations. The user just has to enter the income and expenditures and everything else will be performed by the system.</p>
