        <p>Health complications during the gestation period have evolved as a global
            issue. These complications sometimes result in the mortality of the fetus, which
            is more prevalent in developing and underdeveloped countries. The genesis of
            machine learning (ML) algorithms in the healthcare domain have brought
            remarkable progress in disease diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis. Around 800
            women die every day due to pregnancy and childbirth-related issues. Maternal
            health and fetal health are closely associated with each other because every year
            approximately 3 million newborn babies die. </p><p>So there is a need for proper care
                including the prediction of risk levels before, during and after the delivery for
                the safety of both mother and child. Data mining is a commonly used technique
                for processing enormous data. Researchers apply several data mining and
                machine learning techniques to analyse huge complex data, helping health care
                professionals to predict fetal health. Different algorithms are compared and the
                best model is used for predicting the fetal health.</p>
        <img src="img/portfolio-details-2.png" alt="">
        <p>The aim of the proposed method is to predict whether the gestation fetal is
            normal or not. This can be predicted by a machine learning method. The process
            starts from collecting the data. After collecting the dataset, it is pre-processed
            for removing the unwanted data from the dataset. Machine learning method is
            now used and mostly used in all the departments where it reduces the mistake.
            Many algorithms are used and the best one is used for predicting the fetal
            health.</p>
        <p>Here the scope of the project is that integration of fetal health with
            computer-based prediction could reduce errors and improve prediction outcome.
            This suggestion is promising as data modelling and analysis tools, e.g., data
            mining, have the potential to generate a knowledge-rich environment which can
            help to significantly improve the quality of fetal health prediction.
